Boss:   Welcome to your first day at BackWorks! My name is Arford Clex\n
    and here at BackWorks you will solve some of the hardest (easiest)
    challenges in advanced synchronized robotic control. I must admit that our 
    facilities aren't exactly up to spec, but we strive to make anything 
    possible with synergized group communication and *manager level bizspeak*.
*Speaker*	Warning, stage 4 quantum field collapse eminent in
    Serial Robot Control #1.  Warning, stage 4-
Boss:   We better get you down there quick, no time for proper training, you
    will just have to figure out the controls and try to get the Serial
    Robots back on their charging pads! Our last intern, whom we also
    didn't properly train, did not move the robots back to their charge
    pads once he finished his task. If the robots are not properly charged
    their fusion reactor's quantum containment field will collapse,
    destroying everything!
